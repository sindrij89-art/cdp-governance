            Why CDP Exists
          </h2>
          <p className="mt-6 text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-600">
            CDP was built to address a common failure mode in sales operations:
            opportunities stay &ldquo;open&rdquo; without a recorded decision,
            without clear evidence, and without an agreed next step. In regulated
            environments — pensions, insurance, financial advice — that gap
            creates downstream risk and rework because decisions and
            documentation must stand up to scrutiny. The same drift appears in
            commercial sales outreach, where follow-ups sprawl and
            &ldquo;maybe&rdquo; becomes a default status. CDP is a governance
            overlay designed to support clear Yes&nbsp;/&nbsp;No&nbsp;/
            &nbsp;Still Open outcomes, evidence tracking, and disciplined
            follow-ups — layered on top of your existing CRM. The pilot is
            intentionally constrained and buyer-safe: UK-only, 30 calendar days
            from kickoff, non-renewing by default, and acceptance is
            deliverables-based (D1–D8 delivered), not outcomes achieved.
